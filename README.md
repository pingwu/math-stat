## Probability of getting {k} correct answers for total {n} questions from the multiple choice of {c} possible answers
### Usage
prob-multiple-choice.py n k c
### where
n: is total number of the questions in an exam; aka number of tries for the questions
k: is the number of question guessed correctly; that is (n-k) guess wrong
c: is number of the choices to pick up from; assume only one answer is correct.  Therefore the probability of the guess correct answer per question is (1/c); aka the probability of guess the wrong anser per question is (1 - 1/c) 



## Addtional reference:
What will be the answer if a multiple choice test consisting of 10 {n} questions with four {c} choices each, and the student guesses the answer to each question? What is the probability that he gets 8 {k} questions correctly?
