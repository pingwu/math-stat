## Probability of geeting n correct answers for total x questions from the multiple choice of k
### Usage
prob-multiple-choice.py n x k
### where
x: is total number of  the questions; aka number of tries for the questions
n: is the number of the correct answer guess correctly; that is (x-n) guess wrong
k: is number of the choices to pick up from; assume only one answer is correct.  Therefore the probability of the guess correct answer is (1/k)



## Addtional reference:
What will be the answer if a multiple choice test consisting of 10 questions with four choices each, and the student guesses the answer to each question? What is the probability that he gets 8 questions correctly?
